      "content": [
        "Edge computing is a distributed IT architecture where data processing occurs near the source of data generation, such as IoT devices or local servers. Unlike traditional models that send raw data to centralized data centers for analysis, edge computing ensures that critical data is processed at or near the network’s edge. This significantly reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and provides faster insights.",
        "For instance, a smart security camera equipped with edge computing capabilities can analyze video feeds locally to detect suspicious activity. Only relevant data, such as alerts or critical clips, is sent to the central server, reducing the load on network resources. By prioritizing proximity to data sources, edge computing ensures quicker responses and better operational efficiency."
